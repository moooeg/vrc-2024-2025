# Frij 75477M
This repository contains team 75477M's code for the [2024-2025 High Stakes](video) season of the VEX robotics competition.

Having the code in a git remote allows us to collaborate as a team easily as everyone has access to the codebase and any changes can immediately be reflected across all our devices. 

#### Programming
Frij's code uses purely Python. You can find the wiring guide at the top of main.py for the brain's port configuration.

#### Mechanical Subsystems
