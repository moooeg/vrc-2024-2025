# Frij 75477M
This repository contains team 75477M's code for the [2024-2025 High Stakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sx6HJSpopeQ) season of the VEX robotics competition.

Having the code in a git remote allows us to collaborate as a team easily as everyone has access to the codebase and any changes can immediately be reflected across all our devices. 

#### Programming Info
- Frij's code uses purely Python. You can find the wiring guide at the top of main.py for the brain's port configuration.
- Our program includes a selection screen for easily selecting autonomous code suited for each starting position.
- Code in this repository is similar to our code used last year for Over Under. Last year's code can be found [in a seperate repo](https://github.com/peterdev22/vrc-over-under).

Thank you, from the Frij team,
